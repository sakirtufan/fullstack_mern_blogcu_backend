# Getting started


To get the Node server running locally:
* Clone this repo
* `npm install` to install all required dependencies
* Create MongoDb Cluster and Get Connection MongoDb URI
* Set environment variables in `.env`
  * Set `MONGO_URI = <YOUR_MONGO_URI>`
  * Set `JWT_SECRET_KEY = <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>`
  * Set `SMTP_EMAIL=<YOUR_GMAIL_EMAIL>`
  * Set `SMTP_PASS=<YOUR_GMAIL_PASSWORD>`
* `npm run start` to start the local server

# Code Overview 
## Dependencies
* [Expressjs](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - The server for handling and routing HTTP requests
* [mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) - For modeling and mapping MongoDB data to JavaScript
* [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) - Zero-Dependency module that loads environment variables
* [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) - Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property
* [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) - For providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
* [express-async-handler](https://github.com/Abazhenov/express-async-handler) - For handling exceptions inside of async express routes and passing them to your express error handlers.

## Application Structure
* `index.js` - The entry point to our application. This file defines our express server and connects it to MongoDB using mongoose. It also inncludes the routes we'll be using in the application.
* `routes/` - This folder contains the route definitions for our API.
* `models/` - This folder contains the schema definitions for our Mongoose models (Post).
* `controllers/` - This folder contains controllers for our API.
* `middlewares/` - This folder contains middlewares for our API.
* `helpers/` - This folder contains helper functions for adapting 3rd party libraries for our API.

## Error Handling
In `middlewares/errors/customErrorHandler.js`, we define a error-handling middleware for handling Mongoose's errors and our own errors.
